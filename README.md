# Night-Light

![Light](/img/img_1.jpg)

A simple arduino project I made a couple of years ago for New Year. The construction is first 3D printed, then joined together with superglue and some sticks, then the electronics get added and evetything is covered in plain paper. Ta-da, it's complete :)

## Construction notes and wiring

![Scheme](/img/scheme.png)

The central piece expects a WS2812 strip of 15 LEDs with 60 LEDs / 1m and get connected through pin 6.

Two remaining LEDs get soldered in the air on both sides of the star and get connected through pin 5.

## General notes

All the wiring is done in the air and relies solely on wires connected to the led strip, so solder carefully. The micro USB port is simply glued to the frame, although I will probably add some part to the frame to screw attach it to.
